# PythonAssembly
Assembly routines callable from Python for numerical/data science use.

## Why?
I worked in assembly from the Z80 all the way up to the i386 many years ago, writing everything from encryption routines to protected mode operating systems and had a lot of fun doing so.
Assembly programming is a great learning aid to fully understand how computers work.

## Why Python/Data Science?
These days I use R and Python mostly as a data scientist/researcher, so figured it would be good to refresh my assembly knowledge in the same context.
So it's not about speed, it's about having fun.

## Please Help
It would be great if this repo is extended by anyone else, by adding more routines that are often used in numerical or statistical programming.

## NOTE:
I work pretty much exclusively on Linux, so this repo and code is geared towards NASM under Linux, although it should be easy to port to Windows or Mac.
See the sample Python file for usage, and make using the makefile provided.
